PROJECT TITLE: course (s)crap

course (s)crap is a way for current and past I School students to describe the course offerings at the school using a community-ranked controlled vocabulary of tags (to help us cut through the metacrap). Future or current students who are interested in course offerings can search by tag to see what courses match their interests.

Known bugs
- Would prefer to use AJAX call when adding/voting on tags rather than reloading page
- When you add a new tag to an existing search, it does not add the new term into the search query box
- Layout breaks a little bit in Firefox
